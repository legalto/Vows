Today, surrounded by people who love us, I choose you, Becky, to be my wife. I am proud to be your husband. 
You are the most beautiful, smart, and generous person I have ever known, and I promise always to respect you.
I love our relationship. Even in times of adversity, we are always there to lift each other up. We have each others backs. We each bring our own unique strengths to the relationship, and even find ways to push each others boundaries such as doing a 5 day marathon at Disney or rock climbing while occasionally encountering bears.
I am thankful for all the wonderful experiences that we’ve shared, and the joys we will share.
Throughout our lives, I promise to listen to you, and learn from you, to support you, and accept your support, to love you and welcome your love. 
These things I give to you today, and all the days of our life.
